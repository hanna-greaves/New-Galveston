# New Galveston Tourism Board

This is a sample TypeScript, React/Redux project that you might want to fork for your own purposes! It is set up and ready to go.

## Quickstart

`npm i`
`gulp`

The page will transpile the typescript source and be bundled by webpack automatically. It is started with webpack-dev-server in hot mode for your development pleasure.

## Description of tech used
### Typescript
Source (located in the /src folder) is written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), you should use Typescript in your projects because it is awesome. There really is no excuse not to! The typescript is compiled automatically by webpack, but you can also compile it manually with the tsc command (installed to ./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc). Naturally Typescript also supports all the cool modern features of [ES6](https://es6.io/) so you can use those to write nice source too.

The compilation is controlled by `tsconfig.json` and you can find out all about how to configure that file [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html)

### Gulp
Gulp is used to execute common commands. I use it here because it is easier to maintain than a bunch of scripts in `package.json`, there are lots of cool plugins for gulp that let you do lots of cool things, you can find out more about gulp [here](https://gulpjs.com/)

### Webpack
Webpack is everyone's favourite bundler, it is mostly used here in a development only capacity, but you can check out more at [webpack.js.org](https://webpack.js.org).
